* Develop skills making animated/interactive plots 
* Connect data visualizations to science communication, specifically as an educational tool (Chenemi)
* Produce a graph in rayshader (Austin) 

### What do we want to accomplish?
* Communicate big problems in ES with easy to understand visual data graphics
* Build connections between geology and environmental science 
* What skills do we want to develop or refine?
* Interpretation and visualization for the general public

## Expectations:
### What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?
* We should try to communicate ahead of time when things are not going well or if we anticipate events that might take up time.
* Being aware of deadlines
